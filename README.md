Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple two-player game where, at a signal, players make figures with their hands, representing a rock, a piece of paper, or a pair of scissors. The winner is determined according to a set of rules. You can find the official rules under the Resources.

 

A brief summary:

If the two players choose the same “character” it’s a tie, and the game repeats

You have been tasked to create a simple version of this game with Python. In your version, one player will be controlled by the computer and the other player controlled by you - the user (i.e CPU vs Player). 

You should make use of the inbuilt Python module random and its choice method.
